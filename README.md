Sensor and Peripheral Interface Design

1. Understand the concept of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
 Learn how to configure and start timers
 Use PWM to control LED brightness
2. Understand the advantages of using Real Time Clock (RTC)
 Program RTC and use RTC to generate periodic alarm interrupts to toggle an LED
 Perform clock calibration
 Use RTC to update the LCD
3. Understand the basic concept of the timer input capture function
 Handle different events in the interrupt service routine
 Handle timer counter overflow and underflow
 Use a timer to measure the timestamp of a signal edge external to the microprocessor
